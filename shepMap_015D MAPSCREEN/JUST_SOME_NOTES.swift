/*  RE INSTANCE METHOD V CLASS METHOD

You can only call an instance method on an instance of a class. For example, you would have to create an instance of myScript, then call it:

 let script = myScript()
 script.thisIsmyFunction()
 
You can also choose to make thisIsmyFunction a class method (which is formally known as a "type method" in Swift), and call it like the way you are doing right now:

 class func thisIsmyFunction() {...}
 
Note the class modifier in front of func. Of course, this means you can't access self inside the function, because there is no longer an instance of the class.
